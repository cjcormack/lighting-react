# 3D Stage View Upgrade — Multi-Session Plan

## Context

The existing stage view in `lighting-react` is a 2D top-down HTML/CSS layout
(`src/components/stage/StageMarker.tsx`, `src/components/StageOverviewPanel.tsx`)
with fixture positions stored as 0–100% of viewport on `FixturePatch.stageX/Y`.
The backend (`lighting7`) has already shipped the full 3D schema —
`FixturePatchDto` carries `stageX/Y/Z` (metres, Z-up, FOH-relative),
`baseYawDeg/basePitchDeg`, `riggingUuid`, pre-composed `worldPositionX/Y/Z`,
and there are CRUD endpoints for `Rigging` and `StageRegion`. None of those new
fields are surfaced on the frontend.

Goal: upgrade the React app to a 3D stage visualiser per
`/Users/chris/Development/Personal/lighting7/docs/research/stage-vis-discovery.md`,
delivered in independent sessions so each lands cleanly on its own. The
visualiser must:

- render stage geometry, rigging, and fixtures from existing REST data
- track live beam direction and colour from DMX (read via existing channel hooks)
- support visual editing of all three on tablet+ viewports, view-only on phones
- coexist with (toggle to) the current 2D view

## Decisions (confirmed)

- **Coordinates**: reset & start clean. Existing `stageX/stageY` percentages
  are dropped; fixtures are re-placed in the new 3D editor in metres.
- **Live DMX path**: reuse existing per-channel hooks
  (`useSliderValue`, `useColourValue` from `src/hooks/usePropertyValues.ts`).
  Each `<FixtureModel>` reads channels inside `useFrame` and applies pan/tilt
  + colour imperatively. No backend WebSocket changes needed.
- **2D view**: keep as fallback with a user-facing 2D ↔ 3D toggle on the
  stage panel.
- **Edit gate**: view on all viewports; editing enabled at `SM_BREAKPOINT`
  (≥640px). Use existing `useMediaQuery` from `src/hooks/useMediaQuery.ts`.

## Status overview

| Session | Title                              | Status      | Completed | Notes |
|---------|------------------------------------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| 1       | Foundation                         | Done        | 2026-05-03 | Cross-repo: backend now broadcasts riggingListChanged/stageRegionListChanged. Data reset dropped (no meaningful legacy data). |
| 2       | Stage Configuration                | Done        | 2026-05-03 | New "Stage" tab in Project Settings hosts stage dimensions + regions CRUD. |
| 3       | Rigging Configuration              | Done        | 2026-05-03 | Riggings CRUD on new "Rigging" tab; flown-truss defaults on create. |
| 4       | Patching: Rigging-Mounted vs Free  | Done        | 2026-05-03 | Structured rigging assignment + metric stage coords on the patch sheet; legacy 2D map and free-text rigging label retired. |
| 5       | Read-Only 3D Stage View            | Not started | —         |       |
| 6       | 3D Editor Mode                     | Not started | —         |       |
| 7       | Polish (optional)                  | Not started | —         |       |

Status values: `Not started` · `In progress` · `Done` · `Blocked` · `Skipped`.
Update the row on session completion and fill in `Completed` with the
ISO date. Detailed handover notes belong in each session's **Status &
handover** block at the bottom of its section.

**Handover block format** — fill these on completion of every session so the
next one can be picked up cold:

- _Status_: one of the values above
- _Completed_: ISO date
- _What landed_: actual paths added/changed; any deviations from the plan;
  anything reduced in scope
- _Open follow-ups_: anything left for a later session (e.g. "data reset
  button still TODO", "decided to skip stageZ until Session 4")
- _Surprises / decisions_: unexpected behaviour, design tradeoffs taken
  in-flight that the next session needs to know about

## Cross-repo work

- **Pan/tilt range metadata** is a backend gap: `FixtureTypeInfo.properties`
  exposes slider min/max in raw DMX units but not the degree mapping or
  tilt inversion (today that info lives only in `@FixtureProperty`
  annotation strings). This will be fixed in `lighting7` as part of
  Session 5 — adding `degMin`, `degMax`, `inverted`, and an `axis`
  enum (`PAN | TILT | NONE`) to slider property descriptors, populated
  from the Kotlin annotations during registry build. The frontend wires
  these into `<FixtureModel>`'s `useFrame` so live moving-head beam
  direction works on first ship of the 3D view.

---

## Session 1 — Foundation

**Goal**: dependencies, types, queries, coordinate helper, data reset.

- Add deps: `three`, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`,
  `@react-three/postprocessing`, `@types/three`. Update `package.json`,
  `npm install`, verify `npm run build` clean.
- Update `FixturePatch` in `src/api/patchApi.ts:4-23` — add `stageZ`,
  `baseYawDeg`, `basePitchDeg`, `riggingUuid`,
  `worldPositionX/Y/Z` (all `number | null`).
- New RTK Query slices, mirroring `src/store/patches.ts`:
  - `src/store/riggings.ts` — `useRiggingListQuery`, `useCreateRiggingMutation`,
    `useUpdateRiggingMutation`, `useDeleteRiggingMutation`. Tag: `'Rigging'`.
  - `src/store/stageRegions.ts` — same shape. Tag: `'StageRegion'`.
  - Mirror the WebSocket invalidation pattern used at
    `src/store/patches.ts:15-17` so live config sync still works.
- Coordinate helper `src/lib/stageCoords.ts`:
  - `toThree(stageX, stageY, stageZ): Vector3` swizzle for R3F's Y-up default
    (lighting coords are Z-up — easier to swizzle than to flip
    `Object3D.DEFAULT_UP`, since the app already uses default-up Three.js
    nowhere else and we avoid camera-framing surprises).
  - `panTiltToDir(panDeg, tiltDeg): Vector3` per discovery doc lines 109–116.
  - `worldPositionFor(patch, riggings): Vector3` — prefers
    `worldPositionX/Y/Z` if set, else composes from `stage*` + rigging frame.
- **Data reset**: one-time mutation flow that nulls `stageX/Y/Z` on all patches
  with non-null values (existing percentages are meaningless under the new
  metres convention). Either a small admin button on `Patches.tsx` ("Clear
  legacy stage positions"), or done by hand once and relied on. Recommend the
  button — leaves an obvious migration path documented in the UI.

**Critical files**:
- `package.json`
- `src/api/patchApi.ts`
- `src/store/patches.ts` (reference for slice pattern)
- `src/store/riggings.ts`, `src/store/stageRegions.ts` (new)
- `src/lib/stageCoords.ts` (new)

**Verify**: `npm run type-check`, `npm run build`. Confirm new query hooks
return data in DevTools against a project with hand-seeded riggings + regions.

**Status & handover**:

- _Status_: Done
- _Completed_: 2026-05-03
- _What landed_:
  - Frontend deps: `three@^0.171`, `@react-three/fiber@^9.6`,
    `@react-three/drei@^10.7`, `@react-three/postprocessing@^3.0`,
    `@types/three@^0.171`.
  - `src/api/patchApi.ts` — extended `FixturePatch`, `CreatePatchRequest`,
    `UpdatePatchRequest` with `stageZ`, `baseYawDeg`, `basePitchDeg`,
    `riggingUuid`, plus read-only `worldPositionX/Y/Z` on `FixturePatch`.
  - `src/api/riggingApi.ts`, `src/api/stageRegionApi.ts` (new) — DTOs +
    create/update request types + WebSocket subscribe modules listening
    for `riggingListChanged` / `stageRegionListChanged`.
  - `src/api/lightingApi.ts` — `riggings` and `stageRegions` wired in.
  - `src/store/restApi.ts` — added `'Rigging'` and `'StageRegion'` tag types.
  - `src/store/riggings.ts`, `src/store/stageRegions.ts` (new) — RTK Query
    slices mirroring the patches.ts shape, with WS-driven tag invalidation.
  - `src/lib/stageCoords.ts` (new) — `toThree` (Z-up→Y-up swizzle),
    `panTiltToDir`, `worldPositionFor`, plus a `headQuaternionFor` helper
    used by Session 5's `<FixtureModel>` head-rotation update.
- _Open follow-ups_:
  - `worldPositionFor` rigging-frame composition is a translate-only stub.
    Real rotated-frame composition lands in Session 4 (or callers can rely
    on the backend's pre-composed `worldPositionX/Y/Z` until then — that's
    the preferred path anyway).
  - Frontend still has `riggingPosition: string | null` on `FixturePatch`
    and the form. Backend dropped it from `FixturePatchDto`; runtime value
    is `undefined` and existing checks tolerate that. Cleanup happens in
    Session 4 (per the existing plan).
- _Surprises / decisions_:
  - **Cross-repo addition**: lighting7 didn't yet broadcast
    `riggingListChanged` / `stageRegionListChanged`. Added
    `RiggingListChangedOutMessage` / `StageRegionListChangedOutMessage` in
    `Sockets.kt`, extended `FixturesChangeListener` with
    `riggingListChanged()` / `stageRegionListChanged()`, and called them
    from the rigging and stage-region routes. Rigging PUT/DELETE also
    broadcast `patchListChanged` so any rig-mounted patches' world
    positions are re-fetched downstream.
  - **Data reset dropped**: no meaningful legacy `stageX/Y` data exists in
    practice, so the planned admin button on Patches.tsx wasn't built.
  - **Three.js dep majors pinned** to versions known to work with React 19
    (R3F 9.x, drei 10.x, postprocessing 3.x).

---

## Session 2 — Stage Configuration

**Goal**: form-based CRUD for stage regions; project stage dimensions.

- Project-level: confirm `stageWidthM/DepthM/HeightM` are surfaced on
  Project Settings; if not, add the inputs there. Backend already persists.
- New page or section under existing Project Settings: **Stage Regions**.
  - Reuse the table + edit-sheet pattern from
    `src/routes/Patches.tsx` + `src/components/patches/EditPatchSheet.tsx`.
  - Sheet fields: name, centerX/Y/Z, widthM/depthM/heightM, yawDeg, sortOrder.
  - All numeric fields: `<Input type="number">` with `onFocus(e.target.select())`
    pattern from `EditPatchSheet.tsx:214`.
  - Footer: `flex-row justify-between` with destructive Delete + Cancel/Save
    per CLAUDE.md sheet conventions.
- Add to `src/navigation.ts` under Settings or Setup. Likely as a child of a
  new **Stage** group (which will also host Rigging in Session 3).

**Critical files**:
- `src/routes/StageRegions.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/stage/EditStageRegionSheet.tsx` (new)
- `src/navigation.ts`

**Verify**: create a region, edit it, delete it. Confirm WS invalidation makes
a second tab refresh.

**Status & handover**:

- _Status_: Done
- _Completed_: 2026-05-03
- _What landed_:
  - `src/api/projectApi.ts` — `ProjectDetail` and `UpdateProjectRequest`
    extended with `stageWidthM/DepthM/HeightM: number | null`.
  - `src/routes/StageRegions.tsx` (new) — exports `StageRegionsContent`
    (table + "Add region" button + edit sheet) and a
    `StageRegionsRedirect` for `/stage-regions` / current-project deep
    links. Regions sort by `sortOrder` then `id`.
  - `src/components/stage/EditStageRegionSheet.tsx` (new) — single sheet
    for create + edit, with destructive Delete in edit mode. Numeric
    fields treat empty string as `null`.
  - `src/routes/ProjectSettings.tsx` — added a fourth tab "Stage" that
    renders `StageDimensionsCard` (project-level w/d/h inputs hitting
    `useUpdateProjectMutation`) above `StageRegionsContent`.
  - `src/navigation.ts` — added "Stage" child entry under
    `project-settings` (icon: `Box`) so the sidebar deep-links to the
    new tab the same way `patches`/`surfaces` already do.
- _Open follow-ups_:
  - Riggings CRUD lands in Session 3 with the same shape (list page +
    edit sheet, child of `project-settings`).
  - Patch-placement field rework (Session 4) will start consuming
    `useStageRegionListQuery` + the project's stage dims for snap/clamp
    behaviour.
- _Surprises / decisions_:
  - Stage dimensions placed on the new Stage tab (above regions) rather
    than the General tab — keeps spatial config grouped. Confirmed with
    user in plan review.
  - No backend changes needed — Session 1 already exposed the
    stage-dimension fields on `Project`, and `StageRegion` REST + WS
    hooks were already wired.
  - Removed the unused `TabsContent` import from `ProjectSettings.tsx`
    while editing — drive-by cleanup.

---

## Session 3 — Rigging Configuration

**Goal**: form-based CRUD for riggings.

- Same shape as Session 2: list page + edit sheet.
- Fields: `name`, `kind` (free-text or pick from advisory list:
  TRUSS/BAR/BOOM/PIPE/FLOOR_STAND/OTHER), `positionX/Y/Z`,
  `yawDeg/pitchDeg/rollDeg`, `sortOrder`.
- Sensible defaults on create: a flown truss `kind=TRUSS`, `positionZ=4.5`,
  yaw/pitch/roll = 0.

**Critical files**:
- `src/routes/Riggings.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/rigging/EditRiggingSheet.tsx` (new)
- `src/store/riggings.ts` (from Session 1)

**Verify**: round-trip create/edit/delete; confirm
`GET /api/rest/project/{id}/riggings` returns the new entries.

**Status & handover**:

- _Status_: Done
- _Completed_: 2026-05-03
- _What landed_:
  - `src/routes/Riggings.tsx` (new) — exports `RiggingsContent({projectId})`
    with table (Name / Kind / Position / Rotation / Sort columns, hidden at
    sm/md/lg breakpoints), Add button, click-row-to-edit, edit sheet trigger.
    Sorted by `sortOrder` then `id`.
  - `src/components/rigging/EditRiggingSheet.tsx` (new) — single sheet for
    create + edit with destructive Delete in edit mode. `EMPTY_FORM` ships
    flown-truss defaults (`kind=TRUSS, positionZ=4.5, yaw/pitch/roll=0`)
    so an untouched create posts those values verbatim. Dirty-diff PUT on
    edit. Kind is a Select dropdown over the advisory list
    (`TRUSS / BAR / BOOM / PIPE / FLOOR_STAND / OTHER`) — required, no
    null/None option since there are no legacy entries to preserve.
  - `src/lib/utils.ts` — added `formatTriple` and `formatRotation`
    (extracted/shared between the regions and riggings list pages).
  - `src/components/ui/form-fields.tsx` (new) — exports shared
    `FieldGroup` and `NumberField`, replacing the duplicate copies that
    had grown in both edit sheets.
  - `src/routes/ProjectSettings.tsx` — added a fifth tab "Rigging" that
    renders `RiggingsContent` inside the standard `p-4 space-y-4 max-w-3xl`
    wrapper.
  - `src/navigation.ts` — added `rigging` child entry under
    `project-settings` (icon: `Anchor`).
- _Open follow-ups_:
  - Patch-side rig assignment (Mounting select tying `riggingUuid` to a
    rigging) lands in Session 4, plus the `riggingPosition` legacy field
    cleanup carried over from Session 1.
  - `worldPositionFor` rigging-frame composition is still translate-only
    (Session 1 carry-over); real rotated-frame composition or reliance on
    the backend's pre-composed `worldPositionX/Y/Z` is the Session 4 path.
- _Surprises / decisions_:
  - **Kind is a required Select**, not free text. Form state narrows to a
    `Kind` union (`TRUSS / BAR / BOOM / PIPE / FLOOR_STAND / OTHER`); no
    `None` option because there are no legacy entries that could carry an
    out-of-list value.
  - **`EMPTY_FORM` defaults are non-null** (opposite of the StageRegions
    sheet). The create call therefore sends `kind=TRUSS, z=4.5, yaw=pitch=roll=0`
    even when the user touches nothing — exactly the plan's flown-truss
    convention.
  - **Position fields have no `min={0}`** — riggings can sit at negative
    X/Y (downstage of zero). Only StageRegion size fields had a floor.
  - **Skipped a `RiggingsRedirect` export** — Session 2's parallel
    `StageRegionsRedirect` is currently unused, so building one for parity
    would just be dead code.
  - **`Anchor` icon** picked for the truss-hangs-from-structure metaphor.
  - **simplify pass extracted shared helpers**: `formatTriple` to
    `lib/utils.ts` (now used by both regions and riggings tables) and
    `FieldGroup`/`NumberField` to `components/ui/form-fields.tsx` (now
    used by both edit sheets). Dropped the duplicate copies that had been
    pasted into Session 2's files.

---

## Session 4 — Patching: Rigging-Mounted vs Free

**Goal**: edit rig assignment + 3D position on a patch (form-based).

- Rework the Stage section of `EditPatchSheet.tsx:226-235`:
  - Replace `<StageMapField>` (legacy 2D %) with a new `<PatchPlacementFields>`
    component containing:
    - **Mounting** select: "Free" or one of the project's riggings (label =
      `RiggingDto.name`). Bound to `riggingUuid`.
    - **Position** group: `stageX/stageY/stageZ` numeric inputs (metres). Help
      text changes based on mount: "world coordinates" vs
      "offset from rigging origin".
    - **Base orientation** group (collapsible, mostly for moving heads):
      `baseYawDeg`, `basePitchDeg`. Defaults left null.
- Drop `riggingPosition: string` from the form (free-text label, superseded by
  structured `riggingUuid`). Keep the field on the type for now; a follow-up
  can remove it from the DTO once nothing reads it.
- Save flow uses the existing `useUpdatePatchMutation`, partial-PUT pattern at
  `EditPatchSheet.tsx:140-150`. The backend will recompute `worldPositionX/Y/Z`
  on update.
- `Patches.tsx` table: add a "Mount" column showing rigging name or "Free".

**Critical files**:
- `src/components/patches/EditPatchSheet.tsx`
- `src/components/patches/PatchPlacementFields.tsx` (new — replaces
  `StageMapField` for editing)
- `src/routes/Patches.tsx`

**Verify**: assign a fixture to a rigging with offsets; confirm
`worldPositionX/Y/Z` returned on next list query reflects the composition.
Reassign to "Free"; confirm `riggingUuid` clears and world position becomes
the raw `stageX/Y/Z`.

**Status & handover**:

- _Status_: Done
- _Completed_: 2026-05-03
- _What landed_:
  - `src/components/patches/PatchPlacementFields.tsx` (new) — exports
    `PatchPlacementValue` + the component. Mounting `<Select>` (Free + each
    rigging from `useRiggingListQuery`), Position group (X/Y/Z metres) with
    flipping help text ("offset from rigging origin" vs "world coordinates"),
    and a native `<details>` "Base orientation (advanced)" wrapping
    yaw/pitch number fields. Reuses `FieldGroup` + `NumberField` from
    `components/ui/form-fields.tsx`.
  - `src/components/patches/EditPatchSheet.tsx` — replaced `stage` +
    `riggingPosition` state with one `placement: PatchPlacementValue`
    atom; removed `useMemo`/`useRef` imports. Dropped the 300 ms drag-debounce
    `useEffect` and `dragTimerRef` (Session 6 will reintroduce drag-debounce
    inside the 3D editor's own handlers). Dropped the `riggingPresets`
    memo and the `otherFixtures` memo with `StageMapField`. Dirty-diff PUT
    + `hasChanges` now cover `riggingUuid`, `stageX/Y/Z`, `baseYawDeg`,
    `basePitchDeg`. Stage section JSX collapsed from two blocks to a single
    `<PatchPlacementFields>`.
  - `src/routes/Patches.tsx` — added `useRiggingListQuery` and threaded a
    `Map<uuid,name>` into `buildPatchRows`. `PatchRow.riggingPosition`
    swapped for `riggingName`. The "Position" column became "Mount" at the
    same `hidden md:table-cell` slot — rigging name plain, italic
    muted "Free" otherwise.
  - Deleted `src/components/patches/StageMapField.tsx` and
    `src/components/patches/RiggingPositionInput.tsx` — both were only
    referenced by `EditPatchSheet`.
- _Open follow-ups_:
  - `riggingPosition` field still on `FixturePatch` /
    `CreatePatchRequest` / `UpdatePatchRequest` in `src/api/patchApi.ts`
    and read by `src/components/stage/StageMarker.tsx` (legacy 2D marker
    label). Per the Session 4 plan body it stays for now; full DTO removal
    is a follow-up once nothing reads it (likely after the 2D view is
    retired in/after Session 5).
  - `worldPositionFor` rigging-frame composition (Session 1 carry-over) is
    still translate-only. Session 5 callers should prefer the backend's
    pre-composed `worldPositionX/Y/Z`.
- _Surprises / decisions_:
  - **Auto-save dropped, not preserved.** The 300 ms debounced PUT was a
    StageMap-drag affordance; it doesn't belong on a structured form where
    every other field waits for Save. Session 6 reintroduces drag-debounce
    locally inside the 3D editor where it actually applies.
  - **Mount column reuses the Position slot, not appended.** `riggingPosition`
    now arrives as `undefined` from the backend, so the legacy column was
    rendering empty for every row — replacing rather than adding keeps the
    table from gaining a dead column.
  - **Free is italic muted text, not a badge.** Visually quieter than the
    rigging-name plain text, so the "no mount" state recedes while the
    structured assignment reads clearly.
  - **Native `<details>` for Base orientation.** Avoids pulling another
    Radix primitive; `<summary>` styling is the only custom touch.
  - **`useRiggingListQuery` takes a positional `number`**, not the
    `{ projectId }` object I initially wrote — caught at type-check.

---

## Session 5 — Read-Only 3D Stage View

**Goal**: render the scene from REST + live DMX. No editing yet.

- **Backend prep (lighting7)** — extend `PropertyDescriptor` for slider
  properties with:
  - `axis: "PAN" | "TILT" | "NONE"` (defaults to NONE)
  - `degMin: Double?`, `degMax: Double?` — degree mapping at slider min/max
  - `inverted: Boolean` — flips direction (some fixtures invert tilt)

  Populate from existing `@FixtureProperty` annotations in
  `FixtureTypeRegistry.kt` (parse the annotation strings, or, cleaner, add
  optional Kotlin annotation parameters and migrate the registered fixtures
  in the same change). Surface these on `FixtureTypeInfo.properties` over
  REST. Frontend `FixtureTypeInfo` slider type updated to match.
- New route `/stage` (or rename existing). New `src/routes/Stage.tsx` containing:
  - 2D ↔ 3D toggle button (segmented control, persisted in localStorage).
    2D branch renders existing `<StageOverviewPanel>` unchanged.
  - 3D branch renders `<Stage3D>`.
- `src/components/stage3d/Stage3D.tsx` — Canvas root:
  - `<Canvas>` from `@react-three/fiber`, `flat` shadow, `linear` colorspace.
  - `<OrbitControls>` from drei (touch enabled).
  - `<Bloom luminanceThreshold={0.15} intensity={1.7} radius={0.5} />` from
    `@react-three/postprocessing` per discovery doc lines 75–77.
  - Coordinate convention: see `src/lib/stageCoords.ts` swizzle. Camera framed
    to project bounding box (`stageWidthM/DepthM`).
- `<StageRegionMeshes>` — boxes from `useStageRegionListQuery`.
- `<RiggingMeshes>` — long thin boxes from `useRiggingListQuery`, oriented by
  yaw/pitch/roll.
- `<FixtureModel>` — one per patch:
  - Clamp + head group + lens disc + 2 cones + 2 floor pool circles per
    discovery doc lines 42–80.
  - Static position from `worldPositionFor(patch, riggings)`.
  - **Live colour** via `useColourValue` (or `useSettingColourPreview` /
    gel fallback) reusing the same property-resolution logic from
    `StageMarker.tsx:36-46`.
  - **Live intensity** via `useNormalizedIntensity` pattern at
    `StageMarker.tsx:190-204`.
  - **Live beam direction**: read pan/tilt slider values via
    `useSliderValue`, map to degrees using the new `degMin/degMax/inverted`
    metadata, compose with `baseYawDeg/basePitchDeg`, then convert to a
    direction vector via `panTiltToDir`. Apply imperatively to head group
    quaternion + cone + floor pool inside `useFrame`, no React re-renders.
- Reuse colour-source resolution (`findColourSource`,
  `findDimmerProperty` from `src/store/fixtures.ts`) — do NOT duplicate.

**Critical files**:
- `src/routes/Stage.tsx` (new — replaces or wraps current stage route)
- `src/components/stage3d/Stage3D.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/stage3d/StageRegionMeshes.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/stage3d/RiggingMeshes.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/stage3d/FixtureModel.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/stage3d/Bloom.tsx` (new — wraps the postprocess effect)
- `src/lib/stageCoords.ts` (from Session 1)

**Verify**: load page with a stage region, a truss, a few patched fixtures;
confirm meshes render at expected positions. Run a scene that pulses dimmer
and a colour scene — confirm fixture lens + cone + pool change in real time
without React re-renders (observe via React DevTools Profiler).

**Status & handover**: _Not started._

---

## Session 6 — 3D Editor Mode

**Goal**: visual editing on tablet+ viewports.

- Add an "Edit" toggle in `<Stage3D>` toolbar — only enabled when
  `useMediaQuery(SM_BREAKPOINT)` returns true. Phones see view-only.
- **Click-to-edit**: pointer events on each mesh open the relevant existing
  edit sheet — `EditStageRegionSheet`, `EditRiggingSheet`, `EditPatchSheet`.
  Sheets are slide-over so the 3D canvas remains visible behind them and
  changes are seen live.
- **Visual drag**:
  - Stage regions / riggings: drei `<TransformControls>` for
    translate-on-ground-plane. Rotation via gizmo for yaw.
  - Fixtures: depends on mount.
    - Free fixtures: `TransformControls` translate.
    - Rigging-mounted: drag along the rigging's local X axis only (project
      pointer onto the rigging's line; update `stageX` only).
- **Live binding**: drag updates local mesh transform AND the in-flight
  edit-sheet form state. Mutation is debounced (300ms) per the pattern at
  `EditPatchSheet.tsx:76-85` so the backend isn't hammered mid-drag.
- **Add new** affordances: "+ Add Rigging" / "+ Add Region" buttons in the
  toolbar that drop a default-sized object at stage centre, then immediately
  open its edit sheet.
- Form fields on the sheets continue to work — visual is "another input",
  numeric fields stay authoritative for precise placement.

**Critical files**:
- `src/components/stage3d/Stage3D.tsx` (extended)
- `src/components/stage3d/EditModeProvider.tsx` (new — context for selection +
  edit mode toggle)
- `src/components/stage3d/dragHandlers/` (new — translate-on-plane, drag-along-rig)
- existing edit sheets from Sessions 2/3/4

**Verify**: drag a fixture across the floor, see beam pool follow and the
sheet's `stageX/Y` numbers update live; release, then 300ms later see the
PUT fire (Network tab). On mobile width, confirm the Edit toggle is
disabled with an explanatory tooltip.

**Status & handover**: _Not started._

## Session 7 — Polish (optional)

- **Zoom**: read beam-angle DMX channel into cone radius; currently fixed at
  `patch.beamAngleDeg` static value.
- **Performance**: cap `castShadow` to a configurable subset; raycast only the
  selected mesh in edit mode; geometry instancing for repeated truss segments.
- **Gobo / strobe / fixture library**: out of scope per discovery doc lines
  381–387. Track separately.

**Status & handover**: _Not started._

## Cross-cutting verification

- `npm run type-check` and `npm run build` clean at end of every session
  (CLAUDE.md gates these as the pre-commit equivalent).
- Backend: ensure a project has at least one rigging, one stage region, and
  one rig-mounted patch + one free patch for end-to-end testing.
- Manual smoke: start `lighting-react` dev server, point at running
  `lighting7` backend on `:8413`, run a Kotlin scene script that varies
  pan/tilt/RGB/dimmer — confirm 3D scene reflects in real time, no
  per-frame React re-renders, and 2D toggle still works.
