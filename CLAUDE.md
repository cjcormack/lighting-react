# Claude Code Configuration

## Project Overview

This is the React frontend for the DMX lighting controller system. The backend is located at `/Users/chris/Development/Personal/lighting7` (Kotlin/JVM).

## Git workflow

Solo personal repo — commit and push directly to `main`. Do **not** open pull
requests, do **not** create feature branches. The standard "still don't commit
or push without me asking" rule from the global CLAUDE.md still applies; this
section only changes *how* a confirmed commit/push happens (straight to `main`,
no PR).

### Pre-commit gate

```bash
npm run check
```

That's `build` + `test` + `lint`. There's no separate `type-check` step in it:
`build` is `tsc && vite build`, so the standalone `npm run type-check` would run
the same full `tsc` a second time for ~9s of nothing. Use `type-check` on its
own during development when you want types without a build.

Lint is a real gate now. The tree is at 0 errors and 0 warnings, so any finding
ESLint reports is one this change introduced. Fix it rather than committing
over it. `npm run lint` passes `--max-warnings 0`, because plain `eslint` exits
0 on warnings and would wave them through.

**A git hook enforces this.** `.githooks/pre-commit` runs `npm run check` and
refuses the commit if it fails; it skips the run when nothing buildable is
staged (docs, `.idea/`, assets). Enable it in a fresh clone with
`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. Bypass a single commit with
`git commit --no-verify`. It checks the working tree rather than the staged
snapshot — see the comment at the top of the hook for why.

Warnings count. `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` in particular is left at `warn`
because the right answer is case-by-case, not because it can be ignored —
adding a dependency changes when an effect re-runs, so decide deliberately:

- **Add the dep** when the hook genuinely reads a value that can change.
- **Narrow the input** when only part of an object matters — destructure the
  fields the hook actually uses and depend on those (see `useSliderValue` in
  `src/hooks/usePropertyValues.ts`).
- **Memoise the input** when a `?? []` fallback hands out a fresh identity
  every render (see `serverPalette` in `components/busking/PalettePanel.tsx`).
- **Disable with a reason** only when the narrow deps are provably complete —
  say *why* they're complete, naming the callee whose fields you checked (see
  `rigEuler` in `components/stage3d/Stage3D.tsx`).

A bare `eslint-disable` with no justification is not an acceptable fix.

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for bundling and development
- **Radix UI primitives + Tailwind** for UI components (via `src/components/ui/`)
- **Redux Toolkit** with RTK Query for state management and API calls
- **React Router v8** for routing — note there is no `react-router-dom` package in
  v8: import hooks and components from `react-router`, and `RouterProvider` from
  `react-router/dom`.
- **WebSockets** for real-time backend communication

### The `engines.node` range

`^22.22.2 || ^24.15.0 || >=26.0.0` is the intersection of what the dependency
set actually supports, not a tidy floor. **Don't "simplify" it to `>=22.22.2`
or `>=24.15.0`** — both are wrong:

- React Router 8 sets the hard floor at `>=22.22.0`.
- jsdom 30 accepts `^22.22.2 || ^24.15.0 || >=26.0.0` — it skips the
  odd-numbered 25 line entirely, and 24.0–24.14 with it. That's what carves
  the range into three clauses.

Recompute it when a dependency bumps its own `engines`; `npm install` warns
(`EBADENGINE`) rather than failing, so a wrong range is easy to miss.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (check package.json for version)
- The lighting7 backend running on port 8413

### Commands

```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Start dev server with hot reload
npm run build        # Build for production (runs tsc first)
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run lint:fix     # Fix ESLint issues
npm run format       # Format code with Prettier
npm run type-check   # Run TypeScript type checking
npm test             # Run Vitest test suite
npm run test:watch   # Run Vitest in watch mode
```

### Development Server

The Vite dev server proxies API requests:
- `/api/*` -> `http://localhost:8413/api/`
- `/kotlin-compiler-server/*` -> `http://localhost:8413/kotlin-compiler-server/`

WebSocket URL is automatically derived from the current host or can be overridden with `VITE_SOCKET_URL`.

## Key Features

### Scripts
Kotlin scripts for lighting automation. Uses an embedded Kotlin playground for editing with syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and in-browser compilation. Scripts can be compiled and run directly from the UI.

### Scenes & Chases
- **Scenes**: One-shot lighting configurations that run a script with specific settings
- **Chases**: Animated lighting sequences (same component, different mode)

Both use scripts as their base and allow configuring script settings per scene/chase.

### Fixtures
DMX fixture definitions - describes what channels a fixture uses and how to control it.

### Channels
Raw DMX channel control per universe. Shows all 512 channels with current values.

### Palettes

Named, typed (INTENSITY / POSITION / COLOUR / BEAM) collections of **per-fixture**
property values that cues, FX preset rows and programmer entries reference by
identity rather than by value. The stored value is `ref:{paletteUuid}` — a uuid,
not the int id, because int primary keys never appear in the backend's sync
export and are re-minted on import, so `ref:12` would dangle after any import or
clone. Use `id` for REST paths and `uuid` for anything naming a palette inside a
value; `src/lib/programmerValue.ts` owns that grammar.

Editing a palette republishes every live consumer — one edit moves every look
that references it, which is the point of the feature. There is deliberately **no
per-cell palette editor**: you Record from the programmer, or Include → edit on
stage → Update. **Make Hard** (programmer-wide or per cue) is the escape hatch,
replacing references with the literals they currently resolve to.

Two unrelated things are called "palette" in the lighting world, so this repo
qualifies the older one: the positional ordered colour list that FX parameters
index as `P1`/`P2`/`P*` is labelled **"Colour List"** in the UI. Its helpers
(`isPaletteRef` / `parsePaletteIndex` in `components/fx/colourUtils.ts`) mean that
form; the named-palette ones (`isPaletteRefValue` / `parsePaletteRefUuid`) mean
this one. **Never mint a `P<n>` short code for a named palette** — display its
name.

### Cues, Stacks & Triggers
Cues bundle palettes, FX preset applications, ad-hoc effects, and **script hooks** into named snapshots. **Every cue belongs to a cue stack** — there are no standalone cues. A project owns an *ordered* list of stacks (the "show"); a stack owns an ordered list of cues. A stack row can also be a **SEPARATOR** (a label-only divider between stacks). Cues and stacks are authored and run entirely in the **Program** view (`/projects/:projectId/program`, drilling into a stack at `/program/stacks/:stackId?cue=:cueId`) — the old separate "FX Cues" view has been removed.

**Cue numbers** are free-form display labels (`sortOrder` is the authoritative playback order). They are parsed as **prefix + decimal run + suffix** (`S1-3.1` → `("S1-", [3,1], "")`) and only ever compared *within a prefix group*, so `Pre-show 1, Pre-show 2, T2-1, S-1, S-2` is correctly ordered. `src/lib/cueNumber.ts` holds that model and drives the "Fix Order" banner; it mirrors `routes/cueNumbering.kt` in lighting7, which performs the fix — **keep the two in step**.

A cue without an explicit number gets one derived from its position (`cueNumberAuto: true`), recomputed by the backend whenever the stack changes. Auto numbers render dimmed via `AUTO_CUE_NUMBER_CLASS`; clearing the `Cue #` field returns a cue to auto.

**Timed effects**: Preset applications and ad-hoc effects can have optional timing (delayMs, intervalMs, randomWindowMs) to fire after a delay or on a recurring interval. Immediate (no timing) is the default.

**Script hooks** (triggers) automate FX_APPLICATION script execution on cue lifecycle events:
- **ACTIVATION** / **DEACTIVATION** — fire when the cue starts/stops
- **DELAYED** — fire after a configurable delay
- **RECURRING** — fire at an interval with optional randomisation for organic timing

FX definitions have a `timingSource` field (`BEAT` or `WALL_CLOCK`) controlling whether effects sync to BPM or run on a fixed 50Hz wall-clock timer.

## API Communication

The app maintains a persistent WebSocket connection to the backend for:
- Real-time status updates
- Channel value streaming
- Track status updates

REST API is used for CRUD operations on scripts, scenes, fixtures, etc.

## Patterns and Conventions

### State Management
- Use RTK Query hooks (`useXxxQuery`, `useXxxMutation`) for all API interactions
- Queries auto-subscribe to WebSocket updates where relevant
- Avoid local state for data that should be synchronized with the backend

### Components
- Route components in `src/routes/`
- Shared/utility components in `src/`
- Use Radix UI primitives (via `src/components/ui/`) and Tailwind for UI

### Navigation Registry
- All navigation items are defined in `src/navigation.ts`
- When adding a new page/route, add an entry to the `navItems` array in `src/navigation.ts`
- This automatically registers the page in both the sidebar and the Cmd+K command palette
- Dynamic items (e.g. universes) are handled by the `useUniverseNavItems()` hook (`useNavItems()` just returns the static `navItems`)
- **Exception — cards/list sibling routes**: list views that pair with a cards
  view (`/fixtures/list`, `/groups/list`) deliberately have **no** `navItems`
  entry. They're reached via the in-page Cards/List switcher
  (`src/components/ViewSwitcher.tsx`) and Cmd+K item deep links, and the
  sidebar keeps one entry per resource; the cards route redirects to the list
  when the sticky view preference says so. Follow that pattern for any new
  cards/list pair instead of adding a second sidebar row.
- **Same exception — the programmer's sibling views**: `/programmer` (Values) has
  a `navItems` entry, `/programmer/fx` (FX) deliberately does not. It is reached
  via `ProgrammerViewSwitcher` in `src/components/ViewSwitcher.tsx`. Unlike the
  cards/list pair this switcher is **not** sticky and there is no redirect: the
  FX sheet is a diagnostic read of what is running, so landing there because you
  last looked at it — rather than on the values you came to edit — would be the
  wrong default.
- **Same exception — the palette type pages**: `/palettes` has one `navItems`
  entry; the four type routes (`/palettes/colour`, `/palettes/position`,
  `/palettes/intensity`, `/palettes/beam`) do not. They're reached via
  `PaletteTypeSwitcher`, which **is** sticky (unlike Values/FX — the four types
  are peers, not an editor and a diagnostic), plus four Cmd+K deep links from
  `usePaletteTypeNavItems()`. Note **no type owns the bare `/palettes` path**: it
  is its own redirect route to the sticky type. That is what keeps the redirect
  acyclic — its target is always a different route — so nothing here needs the
  `CARDS_LINK_STATE` escape the cards/list pair does. Three instances now; treat
  it as the rule for sibling views rather than a one-off.

### Sheets vs Dialogs

Use **Sheets** (slide-in from right) for any UI that involves editing, forms, or multi-step workflows. Use **Dialogs** (centered modal) only for confirmations, alerts, and status displays.

#### Sheet structure

All sheets must follow this structure using the shared primitives from `src/components/ui/sheet.tsx`:

```tsx
<Sheet open={open} onOpenChange={onOpenChange}>
  <SheetContent className="flex flex-col sm:max-w-md">
    <SheetHeader>
      <SheetTitle>Title</SheetTitle>
    </SheetHeader>
    <SheetBody>
      {/* Scrollable form content — space-y-4 and px-4 pb-4 are built in */}
    </SheetBody>
    <SheetFooter className="flex-row justify-end gap-2">
      <Button variant="outline">Cancel</Button>
      <Button>Save</Button>
    </SheetFooter>
  </SheetContent>
</Sheet>
```

#### Key rules

- **SheetContent**: Always include `flex flex-col`. Use `sm:max-w-md` for standard forms, `sm:max-w-lg` for complex/wide content. On mobile, sheets are fullscreen by default (`w-full` in base class).
- **SheetBody**: Use for all scrollable content areas. It provides `flex-1 overflow-y-auto space-y-4 px-4 pb-4`. Override with `className="space-y-0 p-0"` only when embedding components that manage their own padding (e.g. EffectParameterForm, pickers).
- **SheetFooter patterns**:
  - Create/Edit (no delete): `className="flex-row justify-end gap-2"`
  - Edit with delete: `className="flex-row justify-between"` — Delete button on left, Cancel+Save on right in a `<div className="flex gap-2">`
  - Equal-width actions (busking): `className="flex-row gap-2"` with `flex-1` on each button
- **Buttons**: Use default size in footers (no `size="sm"`). Cancel is always `variant="outline"`. Delete is `variant="destructive"`.
- **Multi-step sheets**: Use `p-0 gap-0` on SheetContent when step 1 needs edge-to-edge content (e.g. picker lists). Use SheetBody in subsequent steps for form content.
- **Sub-view footers** (content embedded inside a parent sheet, e.g. CueEffectFlow): Use `<div className="border-t p-4 flex items-center gap-2">` since SheetFooter can only be a direct child of SheetContent.

### TypeScript
- Strict mode enabled
- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Use interface for object shapes

### Dependencies
- Reaching for a well-maintained library is fine — often better — when the
  alternative is rebuilding non-trivial functionality yourself (a testing
  framework, date/time math, virtualization, etc.). Don't reinvent that.
- But don't add a dependency to solve a trivial problem you could write in a few
  lines (the left-pad trap), and weigh the transitive cost — avoid dragging in a
  large or poorly-maintained tree for a small need ([xkcd 2347](https://xkcd.com/2347/)).
- When it's a genuine judgment call, flag the trade-off and get a quick yes
  before adding, rather than silently growing (or silently avoiding) the
  dependency set.

## Backend API Reference

The backend exposes these main endpoints:

- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/scripts` - Script CRUD
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/scenes` - Scene CRUD
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/fixtures` - Fixture CRUD
- `GET/PUT /api/channels/{universe}` - Channel values
- `GET /api/universes` - Available DMX universes
- `POST /api/scripts/compile` - Compile a script
- `POST /api/scripts/run` - Run a script directly
- `POST /api/scenes/{id}/run` - Run a scene

WebSocket messages use JSON with a `type` field for message routing.
